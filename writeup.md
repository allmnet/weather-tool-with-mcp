# Introduction
LLMs do not have access to realtime data, they are trained on data from a fixed time point, often months before use, and don't they often get updated with the latest data. Prompting Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropics latest and greatest model, for its knowledge cutoff shows just how old the data can be! Its cutoff is October 2024.

This can be a real problem if I need the LLM to help me with anything that's very recent or constantly in flux. A really good example of something that's always changing is the weather! Forecasts are incredibly inaccurate if we try to look weeks let alone months in advanced, so there's really no way an LLM like Claude can consistently and accurately tell me the weather today, if it was trained 3+ months ago. That is, unless we give these LLMs access to tools! Giving LLMs tool access is not something that's really been fully standardized since this is all a relatively new and rapidly evolving space, but Anthropic's MCP is probably the most well-known attempt at a standardized ssytem and it's quickly becoming more and more popular.

It essentially defines a sort of client-server interface (that honestly doesn't feel too different from something like a REST API) through which a piece of client code can call a tool that could be remotely or locally hosted, the internals of this tool are blackboxed from the client code, but, since both the client and server are following MCP there's an agreed upon format for calling tools and passing parameters. MCP also has some nice tooling for Python and a few other languages to make it really easy to spin up a server and write client code.

# My Implemenation
For my implementation I used uv as a dependency manager, Python as the main language, and ollama as the LLM provider. [Source Code and Instructions Here](https://github.com/rairai77/weather-tool-with-mcp), code is also in the appendicies.

My server implementation is pretty straightforward and closely follows code provided by the MCP Python repository examples. Basically it just defines a tool to get todays weather. It also provides a server at 127.0.0.1:50000 but I found that the way the MCP client works, I don't actually need to keep a server running constantly which was interesting. It seems to just boot it up when it needs to call a function.

The client code is also not really that complicated, there's just a lot of weird issues I ran into that I had to deal with in interesting ways. The general flow of the code is that an interactive chat session is created for a model called llama3.1-tool:8b (created based on llama3.1:8b with the custom Modelfile in the appendix). Then, the user can query the LLM and the query will be run through a detector to determine whether the weather tool is relevant or not, if it is, the ollama serve is fed a request containing a description of the weather tool, otherwise it is just fed a regular plain request. Note that the user can also manually choose to have tools sent or not through some settings provided in the chat. After the LLM responds the client code parses the response to see whether or not a tool call was requested, if it was, then the client code calls the tool using MCP and then returns the result back to the model to prompt it for a response based on the tool data. After that that response is displayed to the user, and the conversation continues!

# Technical Challenges
There were a couple weird and annoying issues, especially pertaining to Llama's desire to always use tools. When I had initially written it there was no detection for whether or not to pass the tool along, and for some reason LLama decided that whenever the weather tool was passed to it it absolutely HAD to use it. Even if I just said "hi" it would respond back with the weather in London or New York. Interestingly enough, it was almost always those two cities. I ended up writing this code to basically determine whether or not a query was vaguely weather related before sending the tool over, and that actually worked really well! I've set it as the default mode because of how well it works, butit's a really unsatisfying solution.

It kind of felt like it was manual work instead of the LLM making a choice, so I did some more research. It turns out the LLama3.1:8b Modelfile heavily implies that whenever a tool is provided Llama must use it, so I made some modifications basically telling it that it can ignore tools in the case that they are irrelevant to the query. This has worked really well, but now Llama feels the need to say that it doesn't want to use a tool every time I pass it along to it and it decides not to. For that reason I've still set the default to be using code to determine whether a query is weather related or not.

Another technical issue I encountered was connecting the server to the client. I had missed the example code the first time I looked through the repository, and I guess MCP is still new enough that there's not much in terms of online tutorials. Claude was also not really any help for some reason it gave just completely incorrect advice. I did end up finding good template code in the docs/repo eventually though, and that made things a lot easier. It feels kind of strange though, to spin up the server every single time and I wonder if there's a better approach out there.

# Result Analysis
The model actually performed really well! It's even able to call multiple tools in a single go which I did not expect.
Here's some of the more interesting test cases I ran, and their outputs for the rest of my test cases take a look at the `main.py` appendix:
```
----------------------------------
Testing with input: What's 13 + 13?
Response: 13 + 13 = 26.
```
Here we can see that the LLM did not call any tools, in fact no tools were even provided since the prompt did not get flagged as weather related by my classification code.

```
----------------------------------
Testing with input: What's the weather in London today?
üìù Tools enabled
üîß Tool called for city: London
Response: The current weather in London is clear with a temperature of 3.1¬∞C (37.6¬∞F) and a wind speed of 8.7 mph (14 kph). The humidity is at 87% and there are no precipitation or cloud cover.
```
This one's a little more interesting, We can see that the tools were enabled and called for London before the LLM gave an accurate response detailing the weather conditions in London at the time ( I double checked online ).

```

----------------------------------
Testing with input: is seattle hotter today? or nyc?
üìù Tools enabled
üîß Tool called for city: Seattle
üîß Tool called for city: NYC
Response: Based on the weather data, it appears that Seattle is currently 1 degree Celsius (or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than NYC.
```

This one is even more interesting! In this one the LLM correctly identifies that it needs to call multiple tools and it does so properly! Again, I verified it's result and it's correct. What's interesting is that it didn't show it's work for the math to figure out the temperature difference, it didn't even set up an equation. I worry that this might result in some bad responses in certain situations.
```
----------------------------------
Testing with input: What's the weather in Norway today?
üìù Tools enabled
üîß Tool called for city: Norway
Response: Unfortunately, I don't have real-time access to current weather conditions. However, I can suggest some ways for you to find out the weather in Norway today:

1. Check online weather websites such as AccuWeather or Weather.com.
2. Use a mobile app like Dark Sky or The Weather Channel.
3. Tune into local Norwegian news channels or radio stations for updates.

Please note that my training data is based on static information and does not include real-time updates.

```
At first glance this one seems a little werid since it called the tool for Norway, but then it's saying it doesn't have real time data! I looked into it a bit and basically, as far as I can tell, the weather API I'm using only works for cities so it gave the LLM a response saying that the city was invalid, and so the LLM worked off of that to say that it doesn't have access to realtime data for Norway.

Overall I think the LLM actually did really good with tool use, especially when I don't give it access to tools if it's not deemed relevant by my code.

Here's an example of when I give it access to tools for a non-weather related query:

```
You: how are you?
üìù Tools enabled

llama3.1-tool:8b: I'm not a tool that can be used in this case, so I'll just respond as usual. I'm functioning properly and ready to assist with any questions or tasks you may have. How can I help you today?
```
It first vocalizes it needs to not use a tool. Sometimes it does this, sometimes it doesn't it's pretty inconsistent about it. But it does accurately determine that it doesn't need to use a tool, and then it procedes to not use a tool which is great! So it's still functional, just it's behavior is a little weird.

Here's an example of what happens when I ask plain llama without tools:
```
whats the weather in seattle?
However, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to current
weather conditions. But I can suggest some ways for you to find out the
current weather in Seattle:

1. **Check online weather websites**: You can visit websites like AccuWeather,
Weather.com, or the National Weather Service (NWS) for up-to-date information
on the current and forecasted weather in Seattle.
2. **Use a weather app**: Download a weather app on your smartphone, such as
Dark Sky or The Weather Channel, which provide real-time weather updates and
forecasts.
3. **Check local news websites**: Websites like KOMO News (komonews.com) or
KING 5 (king5.com) often have current weather conditions and forecasts for
Seattle.

As for the typical weather in Seattle, it's known for its:

* Overcast skies: Seattle is famous for being a cloudy city, with an average
of 226 days of overcast skies per year.
* Rainfall: Seattle receives an average of around 37 inches (940 mm) of
rainfall per year, making it one of the rainiest cities in the United States.
* Mild temperatures: The temperature in Seattle is generally mild, ranging
from around 35¬∞F (2¬∞C) in winter to 70¬∞F (21¬∞C) in summer.

Please keep in mind that these are general trends and can vary depending on
the time of year and specific weather conditions.
```
It tries to be as helpful as possible, and it's nice that it doesn't just make up a forecast and weather report, but it just simply can't effectively answer the question. It just doesn't know what the weather is like right now. That makes a lot of sense, because how would it know? Like it says, it doesn't have any access to real-time data.

I think it's pretty clear that tool use improves results in similar scenarios as to when it would benefit a human to have tools. If I asked a person for the weather they're pretty likely to pull out their phone and look at their weather app. In the same way, it's useful for an LLM to be able to do the same. That being said, it seems like giving tools to LLMs in scenarios where they don't actually need to use them can confuse them, so it's important to have some sort of layer in between to decide what tools to give and when. This is a little bit different from humans, as we're pretty good at not using unnecessary things, i.e. we don't look for the weather in New York to respond to 'hi', but the LLM did until I changed up the Modelfile. We also don't actively think 'I dont need to use my weather app to respond to this', we just don't use it. This is something that the LLM seems to still be struggling with. Perhaps an LLM finetuned/trained for tool-use might perform better for this.

# Ethical Considerations
It's pretty tough to know exactly how far this will all go in the future, but with powerful tools like Claude Code, and Manus coming out recently it's pretty safe to say that these models will be able to interact with a diverse number of things not too dissimilarly from how a human does. Additionally, the backbone of these tools appears to be tool use.

Tool use is essentially allowing LLMs to do a couple of things. I think the least dangerous thing LLMs can do with tool use is just to gather new information, for example, looking at wikipedia pages, the news, the weather report, etc. There's not really much/any direct harm from this other than potentially finding biased sources and not having the critical thinking skills to properly separate fact from fiction, and so providing the user faulty information. But, tool use can be a lot more dangerous than just this! Tool use allows LLMs to actually impact our world! As LLMs become more powerful and better at using tools, we can expect a lot more power to be in everyone's hands, including bad actors. This could be dangerous, since what's to stop someone from running a powerful local LLM and giving it access to some machines and money and telling it to hack into some system (obviously LLMs are not the greatest hackers as of now, but they are certainly better than they were 2 years ago, and as far as I can tell there's no reason to think they won't continue to improve, although to what degree is unclear). In fact, even more interesting than that, Palantir is working with the US government and military to give LLMs the ability to deploy drones and other sorts of things. It's pretty scary to think about what could happen down the line if autonomous AI agents are granted access to our military equipment. 

Another consideration is simply the fact as these LLMs become able to do more and more stuff for us, I think we will have a harder time finding meaning. A lot of jobs will be largely automated away, and we're even already starting to automate away human interaction (responding to emails with AI). It's hard to know what the possible consequences could be for things like this, but I can't imagine it won't have severe negative impacts on many peoples' mental health. I've already heard of more than a few people who turn to AIs like ChatGPT to be their closest friend and/or therapist, now what if ChatGPT is given access to enough tools to be able to do pretty much everything? What reason would they have to interact with other real people? What sort of impacts might that have on individual people and society as a whole?

# Future Improvements and Considerations
I looked into the tool use issue a bit further, and it seems like sometimes people use another LLM call in between that will essentially decide whether or not a query needs tool use before then querying the LLM with or without the tool depending on what was decided. This is a pretty interesting approach, and I'd definitely try it out if doing this again, as it seems pretty promising. I didn't use this approach this time since I learned about it a little bit too late into the assignment and it would've taken a considerable amount of time to make it work for my current approach.

I would like to look into exactly how to make the server not have to boot up and shut down every call. It feels really wasteful and adds unnecessary latency to the already slow process of talking to a local LLM. I believe I might be able to refactor the code to use a single client session by wrapping everything in the with clause, or by using a variable to store the session.

I would also like to try to do this with more tools and see how much it can handle, especially if I can get an LLM to decide when/if to pass which tool. I wonder if it could make for a personal assistant of sorts. Although maybe a bigger model might be better for that.
